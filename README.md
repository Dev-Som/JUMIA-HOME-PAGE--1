#### HOW TO CONTRIBUTE 

To contribute the project, the following should be done 
1. Fork the repo by clicking on the fork sign on the top of this page.

2. Clone your fork of the repo by clicking on the green button you'll see in your fork. copy the url. Navigate to the directory you want to place the file,
open your git bash and type in `git clone url_you_copied`. This should provide a local copy of this repo on your device.

3. Make changes in your local branch (repo) using your VS code or any editor you make use of or the command line interface.

4. Checkout to a new branch. This is to avoid making changes to the `master` branch.
Navigate to the cloned repo and checkout to a new branch. Type in  `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` on git to do this. Branch_name can be the name of the section you worked on.

5. Commit your changes by staging them using `git add .` The space and the fullstop is needed.
Commit by typing `git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES"`. 

6. Push your commits. When you are done making all of your changes, upload these changes to your fork using `git push origin BRANCH_NAME`.
This would push them to the branchname in your forked repo. 

7. Make a pull request. 
Return to your fork on GitHub, and refresh the page. You may see a highlighted area that displays your recently pushed branch
Click the green Compare & pull request button to begin the pull request.
